# fsa-express-sequelize-prototyping
A starter kit to help rapidly prototype a functional marketplace and develop a REST API for accessing a Relational Database like PostgreSQL using Sequelize ORM. API authorization comes courtesy of Cognito Express, a great library to process Cognito JWT tokens for accessing API's.

Using Sequelize, you will define your database schema with JavaScript - raw SQL not required. This will help you make changes to your database faster, as you won't have to re-write a bunch of queries to account for new tables or table attributes you decide to add. For projects you want to bootstrap and get up & running, this is a great tool for adding the power of a relational database.
